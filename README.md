# CAT-Dog-classification
I developed a deep learning model using CNN with TensorFlow to classify cat and dog images. Implemented on Google Colab and python, it achieved high accuracy and used data augmentation for better generalization.
**Cat and Dog Image Classification**
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification, specifically to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is developed using TensorFlow and implemented in Python on Google Colab. The dataset used consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, and the model achieves high accuracy with data augmentation for improved generalization.

**Project Overview**
The main goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that classifies images as either a cat or a dog. The model is trained using a CNN, which is highly effective for image classification tasks. The key features of the project include:

-Use of multiple convolutional layers to extract image features.
-Application of data augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
-High accuracy and precision in classification performance.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. The images are split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model performance.

*Training set*: Used to train the model.
*Test set*: Used to evaluate the model's final accuracy and precision.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
-TensorFlow and Keras for model creation and training.
-Google Colab for cloud-based implementation and fast GPU processing.
-NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
-Data Augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip) to increase the variety in the dataset.

**Model Evaluation**
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set and achieved high accuracy and precision in classifying the images. The key evaluation metrics include:

*Accuracy*: The percentage of correctly classified images.
*Recall and F1 Score*: Optional metrics for further evaluation.

*Accuracy*: ~97%
*Loss*: Gradually decreases over epochs.
